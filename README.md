# Hi! :smile:
Over the past year, I've been making a variety of websites and even some freelancing. I have the skills required to code a lot of different websites, but I want to focus on improving my fundamentals. I'm currently using Frontend Mentor to hone my experiences & improve on my readability, maintainability, responsive design, accessibility, and SEO skills. Likewise, I'm using Frontend Mentor to learn scss/sass.
