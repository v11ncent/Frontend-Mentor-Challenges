# Hi!
Over the past year, I've been making a variety of websites and even some freelancing. I have the skills required to code a lot of different websites, but I want a solid & comprehensive understanding of the basics so that I can further improve my skills. I'm hoping Frontend Mentor challenges can help me improve on my basics even more.
